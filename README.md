# Future Endeavors
We aim to introduce a roommate matchmaking feature, allowing users to create profiles, answer a series of questions, and receive personalized recommendations for potential roommates. This system would function similarly to popular dating apps like Tinder but with the added layer of BU authentication to ensure that users are indeed BU students. This feature will help students find compatible roommates for their BU experience.
